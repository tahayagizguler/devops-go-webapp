# 🚀 Go Web App Deployment

## 🌟 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Go Web App Deployment** project! This initiative focuses on creating a robust web application using Go, containerizing it with Docker, and deploying it on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). We aim to streamline our development workflow with a modern CI/CD process powered by GitHub Actions and ArgoCD, ensuring seamless updates and scalability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Go:** The powerful programming language at the heart of our web application.
- **Docker:** For containerizing our app, making it easy to deploy and manage.
- **AWS EKS:** Our Kubernetes cluster provider, simplifying cluster management.
- **Kubernetes (K8s):** Orchestrates application resources, ensuring high availability.
- **Helm:** The package manager for Kubernetes, simplifying deployment and configuration.
- **Ingress-NGINX:** Facilitates load balancing and routing for incoming traffic.
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates our CI process, running tests and builds on every commit.
- **ArgoCD:** Our GitOps tool for continuous deployment, keeping our live application in sync with our repository.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Development:** Build a dynamic web application using Go, encapsulated in a Docker container for easy deployment.
2. **Kubernetes Cluster Creation:** Spin up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS for managing our application.
3. **Resource Setup:** Define Kubernetes resources (deployments, services, etc.) using YAML files to control our app's behavior.
4. **Deployment with Helm:** Package the application with Helm for efficient deployment and configuration management.
5. **Load Balancing:** Implement Ingress-NGINX to distribute traffic evenly across instances.
6. **CI Process:** Utilize GitHub Actions to automate testing and building of code with each change.
7. **CD Process:** Leverage ArgoCD to automatically apply updates, ensuring continuous deployment.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to elevate a Go-based web application to new heights by employing modern cloud infrastructure practices. By integrating containerization, automated testing, and streamlined deployment processes, we enhance development speed and operational efficiency.
